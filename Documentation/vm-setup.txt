IPS
A) ubuntu machine
1) Public ip: ip of the router.
2) Internal Ip or private ip: assign by the router
3) tailscale ip

Flow: 198.x.x.x (host ip) --> x.x.x.x (router public ip) --> request to the internet

B) Virtual Machine:
1) Internal Ip: assigned by the virtual box
2) tailscal ip

Flow: If virtual machine have to talk to the internet then it make the request, and host will act as a router and nat, it change the source ip from the interal ip to it own private ip and send the packet to the router then router do the nat change the source ip to it public ip.

10.x.x.x(private vm ip) --> 198.x.x.x (host private ip)
198.x.x.x(host private ip --> x.x.x.x (router public ip) --> request to the internet
