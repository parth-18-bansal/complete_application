# Swap disbaling
There is the swap in the linux, whenever RAMs get full, the operating system assign some space of the harddisk as RAM. And this special
RAM is called the swap. We disable it in the kubernetes, because scheduler assign the pods according to the nodes statistic like
RAM, CPU, Harddisk etc. so swap enabling can cause confusion for the scheduler to decide which node to use. So by default we need swap off
But there are some configuration, by which we can setup the kubernetes node with swap on also.

* Overlay
It is for setuping the OverlayFS filesystem, it used by the containerd for managing the images and storage.

* br_netfilter
it allow the linux kernel's netfilter subsystem to implement the iptable rules on the pod network.
